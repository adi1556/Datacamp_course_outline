# Datacamp Course Outline

Chapter 1 – Vectors 
*       Sales Pitch
Data Science is all fluff without understanding the underlying maths. It gives you a solid foundation. Helps you understand the internal workings of an ML model. Ultimately helps you choose the correct model and for a specific problem and a specific dataset. Helps in understanding the hyper parameters of that model and how to tune them to get the best possible result. This is what gives the edge over a business analyst and makes you a true data scientist.
*	Lesson 1.1 – Introduction to Vectors
	*	Learning Objective: Define a vector and identify a basic intuition of vectors. 
*	Lesson 1.2 – Vector Operations
	*	Learning Objective: Compute vector addition and dot product using hand.
